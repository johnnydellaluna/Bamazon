# Bamazon

// Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront usable through command line applications. It uses the npm packages mysql and inquirer, the first of which pulls data (products, prices, and quantities) from a mysql database, and the latter serves as a way to interact with the store using prompts.//

//When users start bamazon-customer.js, they will be greeted with a listing of all of the products in the store (my sql database) and a prompt to input an item id.//

//The user then selects how many of the product they wish to purchase, and on that submission Bamazon knows to subtract that total from the store quantity, charge the customer, and give them an updated view.//

//Please see screenshots in this Github repository.//
